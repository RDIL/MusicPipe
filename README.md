# MusicPipe

MusicPipe (working title, subject to change) is my attempt at building a webapp for managing songs, albums, etc. throughout the release, and after.

## Goals

- Help musical artists get their songs to publishers
- Help publishers/labels keep metadata all together
- Have a usable UI
- Version control of songs/metadata
- Be able to export to various formats

## Non-Goals

- Become a paid product, as that would be a lot of work

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute anything, large or small. This app is made with Next.js, React, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## License

I haven't decided on a license yet, feel free to open a PR to propose one. It's going to need to be a FOSS license though.
